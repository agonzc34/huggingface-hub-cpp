# huggingface-hub-cpp

This library is a C++ port of the [Hugging Face Hub](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) that provides an implementation of hf_hub_download for C++. It enables seamless downloading of models and other assets from the Hugging Face Hub while maintaining full compatibility with its Python counterpart.

With this library, C++ developers can integrate Hugging Face model downloads directly into their applications, ensuring efficient and reliable access to AI resources without requiring Python dependencies.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- CMake (Minimum version recommended: 3.x)
- libcurl (Required for handling downloads)

On Debian-based systems, you can install libcurl using:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

### Build

To build the project, follow these steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/agonzc34/huggingface-hub-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

### Integrating the library

To use this library in your C++ project, include the necessary headers and call `hf_hub_download`.

```cpp
#include "huggingface_hub.h"

int main() {
  std::string repo_id = "<huggingface-repo>";
  std::string filename = "<file-to-download>";

  if (huggingface_hub::hf_hub_download(repo_id, filename).success) {
    std::cout << "Model downloaded!" << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "Error" << std::endl;
  }
```

### Running the demo app

A demo application is included to showcase the library in action. To build and run the demo:

```shell
./build/hfhub_demo
```

This will execute a sample download for the qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q2_k.gguf model
